# Weather-Reporter
In this application you can access any city or country's temperature,wind speed, humidity,rain amount and etc.
For acccessing all over world data I used an API named as OpenWeatherMap it helps in accessing all data regarding weather
For using API in my code you just have to go on their site and sign up and there you will get an API_Token through which you can access this API
And Hurray!!!! Your weather reporter app is ready to use just after installing some libraries and running some lines of code.
